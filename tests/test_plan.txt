Testing is expected to be fairly comprehensive and professionally handled.
Test preparation: 
• Documentation of purpose, design and execution of test plans.
• Summary of results with commentary and evaluation. 
• Detailed analysis of informative samples

Component testing:
• Analysis of components to show that they are appropriate for the intended purpose, conceptually sound and mathematically and statistically correct.
• Testing of accuracy of model (e.g. pricing is accurate or risks are accurately reﬂected).


Robustness testing:
• Testing the stability and robustness of the model (sensitivity to changes in market conditions and to deal speciﬁcations).
• Assessment of the limitations of the model (parameter ranges, assumptions, etc).
• Assessing behavior over a large range of inputs. • Assessing impact of assumptions. 
• Identifying situations where the model performs poorly orbecomes unreliable.
• Testing under actual circumstances and with a variety of market conditions, extreme values, etc.
• Assessing impact of model results that feed other models. 
• Application of a variety of tests (statistical, accuracy, etc).
