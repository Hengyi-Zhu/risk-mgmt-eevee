1. Required packages
2. Functions for calculation system
  2.1. What can be done? What cannot be done? (basic assumptions)
3. Input testing
  3.1. If there are missing input fields
  3.1. If tickers are provided correctly
  3.2. If weights sum up to 1
4. Implementation
  4.1. Go through steps
  4.2. Dependency among methods: if one method needs to be executed before running another? (still global/local variable issue)
5. User guideline (show sample output of AAPL, [AAPL, AMZN])

Requirements document: 
• The purpose of the model. 
• The scope of use of the model. 
• Performance requirements of the model.

The design document justiﬁes the choice of model, including:
• Justiﬁcation of model choice by reference to published research and/or sound documented industry practices.
• Explanation of the mathematical speciﬁcation and numerical techniques in detail.
• Analysis of the assumptions, merits and limitations, including the extent to which risks are captured.
• Comparison with alternative approaches.
• Documentation and validation of subjective components (such as ﬁne tuning based on expert knowledge).

Data is a critical component. 
• Problematic data = questionable results.Data analysis includes:
• Documentation of the data being used. 
• Rigorous assessment of the data quality. 
• Demonstration that the data is suitable for the model andconsistent with the theory and methodology. 
• Identiﬁcation, justiﬁcation and documentation of all proxies used. 
• Documentation and analysis of all assumptions made whenadjusting data (data cleaning, data smoothing, data averaging, etc).
